    <h1>Automated Nuclei Detection in Microscopy Images</h1>
    <p>A Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches</p>
  </div>

  ## Introduction

  The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated nuclei detection system for microscopy images. Accurate nuclei detection is crucial in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics as it enables efficient cell segmentation, counting, and downstream analysis. In this project, we compare two distinct methodologies:

  - **Deep Learning Approach:** Utilizing the U-Net architecture for segmenting nuclei from microscopy images.
  - **Traditional Approach:** Leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction coupled with a Random Forest Classifier for predicting the presence of nuclei.

  ## Project Motivation

  Detecting nuclei accurately is essential for:
  - **Biomedical Research:** Facilitating quantitative image analysis and understanding cellular processes.
  - **Clinical Diagnostics:** Aiding in early disease detection and prognosis.
  - **High-Throughput Screening:** Enabling rapid and reproducible analysis of large volumes of microscopy data.

  This project aims to combine the power of deep learning with the interpretability of traditional machine learning to provide a robust solution for nuclei detection.

  ## Dataset Description

  The dataset comprises high-resolution microscopy images with corresponding segmentation masks. In particular:
  - **Training Data:** Contains images and multiple segmentation masks per image, requiring preprocessing to consolidate one binary mask per image.
  - **Test Data:** A separate set of images used to evaluate model performance.

  More details on the dataset can be found on the [Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/data).

  ## Methodology

  ### Deep Learning Approach: U-Net

  The U-Net architecture is specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. Our implementation involves the following key steps:

  1. **Image Preprocessing**
      - **Resizing:** All images are resized to a fixed dimension of \(256 \times 256\) pixels.
      - **Normalization:** Pixel values are scaled appropriately.
      - **Mask Consolidation:** Multiple mask files are combined into a single binary mask per image.

  2. **Model Development**
      - **Encoding/Contracting Path:** Consists of multiple convolutional layers with max-pooling to extract semantic features.
      - **Decoding/Expanding Path:** Uses transposed convolutions and skip connections to recover spatial resolution and refine the segmentation.
      - **Output:** A sigmoid activated convolutional layer returns the final segmentation mask.

  3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
      - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
      - Metrics such as accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) are monitored.
      - Advanced techniques like Grad-CAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) are used for interpretability.

  #### U-Net Architecture Visualization

  Visualizations include:
  - **Activation Maps:** Examination of feature activations across layers.
  - **Grad-CAM:** Identification of the areas on the image that contribute most to the model's prediction.
  - **LRP Reports:** Detailed analysis of region relevancy within the prediction process.

  ### Traditional Approach: VGG16 + Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

  This approach employs a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction followed by a Random Forest Classifier:

  1. **Feature Extraction**
      - **VGG16:** Utilized as a fixed feature extractor (with weights pretrained on ImageNet) to preserve critical image features.
      - **Layer Selection:** Features are extracted from early convolutional layers (e.g., `block1_conv2`) to maintain spatial detail.

  2. **Classification with RFC**
      - The extracted deep features are reshaped and fed into a Random Forest Classifier.
      - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Techniques such as grid search and Optuna are used to optimize the classifier.
      - **Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU are computed.

  3. **Result Visualization**
      - An interactive dashboard is created using Plotly and Seaborn to present performance results and hyperparameter tuning history.

  ## Implementation Details

  **Tools & Libraries:**
  - **TensorFlow & Keras:** For implementing and training the U-Net model.
  - **OpenCV:** For image manipulation and visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** To build and evaluate the Random Forest Classifier.
  - **Optuna:** For automated hyperparameter optimization.
  - **Plotly & Seaborn:** For the creation of interactive dashboards and rich visualizations.

  **Hardware Considerations:**
  - GPU acceleration is utilized to speed up model training.
  - A CPU fallback mechanism is implemented to ensure stable predictions when GPU memory constraints arise.

  ## Results and Analysis

  The comparative analysis of the two methodologies revealed that:
  - **U-Net (Deep Learning):** Achieves superior segmentation performance with high IoU and provides detailed interpretability through Grad-CAM and LRP visualizations.
  - **VGG16 + RFC (Traditional):** Offers a robust baseline with competitive performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep feature extraction even with traditional classifiers.

  **Key Visualizations:**
  - **Segmentation Outputs:** Direct comparisons between the input images, ground truth masks, and model predictions.
  - **Filter Activations and Heatmaps:** Visual insights into the convolutional layers' activations.
  - **Optimization Dashboards:** Graphical representations of performance metrics, ROC curves, and hyperparameter optimization history.

  ## Future Directions

  Potential future enhancements include:
  - **Advanced Data Augmentation:** To further improve model robustness.
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple deep learning architectures to boost performance.
  - **Real-Time Applications:** Integration of the system for live microscopy imaging.
  - **Deployment:** Creating interactive web applications for clinical diagnostic use.

  ## Conclusion

  This project showcases an innovative approach to nuclei detection that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with traditional machine learning methods. The U-Net model provides high-quality segmentation with explanatory visualizations, while the VGG16 + RFC pipeline offers a solid baseline that enhances our understanding of feature extraction and classification.

  Ultimately, the fusion of these methodologies paves the way for more accurate and interpretable biomedical image analysis tools, which can have significant real-world applications in research and healthcare.
